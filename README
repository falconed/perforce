= Perforce - Streamlined wrapper for p4ruby.

The classes Perforce and Perforce::Changelist present a simplified
interface to the Perforce API.  They encapsulate all the functionality
I needed for scripting Perforce in a recent project.

These are small classes implemented atop P4, the class installed by
the P4Ruby package.  The underlying P4 object is always available
with Perforce#p4.  See http://p4ruby.rubyforge.org.
